Hello traveler! :wave:

You've stumbled into one of my mini projects. Here have a snack üçé!

## Description
Sometimes when I'm reading a cool book, I end up skipping lines and missing some context. This mini project was made just because I thought it would be funny to read things one at a time.

Users will be able to write/copy-paste a paragraph and the website should show the words one at a time - quite simple.
